# AI-Powered Oncology Insights Platform

## Overview

**Live Demo:** [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zhangju2023/oncology-ai-insights)

This project demonstrates how AI and real-world data (RWD) can be leveraged to extract actionable insights in oncology. It simulates a workflow for clinical decision support, drug development, and patient outcome prediction using synthetic data and modern AI tools.

## Features
- **Synthetic Oncology Data**: Simulated EHR, genomics, and treatment datasets.
- **NLP Pipelines**: Extract cancer staging, treatments, and adverse events from unstructured clinical notes.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast patient survival or treatment response using XGBoost/LightGBM.
- **Clustering**: Identify patient subgroups with similar biomarker or treatment profiles.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize trends and model outputs with Streamlit or Dash.

## Impact
This project illustrates how AI can:
- Support oncologists in making data-driven decisions
- Identify clinical trial candidates
- Uncover hidden patterns in oncology RWD

## Credits
Inspired by real-world oncology data science and Ontada-style data models.
